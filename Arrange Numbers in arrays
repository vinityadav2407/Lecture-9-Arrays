Problem statement:-
You have been given an empty array(ARR) and its size N. The only input taken from the user will be N and you need not worry about the array.

Your task is to populate the array using the integer values in the range 1 to N(both inclusive) in the order - 1,3,5,.......,6,4,2.

Note:
You need not print the array. You only need to populate it.

Constraints :
1 <= t <= 10^2
0 <= N <= 10^4

Time Limit: 1sec
Sample Input 1 :
1
6
Sample Output 1 :
1 3 5 6 4 2
Explanation of Sample Input 1 :
Since the value of N is 6, the number will be stored in the array in such a fashion that 1 will appear at 0th index, then 2 at the last index, in a similar fashion 3 is stored at index 1. Hence the array becomes 1 3 5 6 4 2.

Solution:->

public class Solution {

    public static void arrange(int[] arr, int n) {
        int count = 1;
        if (n == 0) {
            return;

        }
        for (int i = 0; i <= (n - 1) / 2; i++) {

            arr[i] = count;
            count = count + 2;
        }
        count = 2;
        for (int i = n - 1; i > (n - 1) / 2; i--) {
            arr[i] = count;
            count = count + 2;

        }

    }
}
